# Coursera - Practical Machine Learning Assignment

## Introduction
Dataset Human Activity Recognition contains classes (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting) collected on 8 hours of activities of 4 healthy subjects. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. The training set will be used to build machine learning models.
